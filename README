Overview
--------

hnews_popup is a jquery plugin to provide a little popup box for pages
containing hNews markup. hNews is a draft microformat for marking up news
articles (or blogs), and is defined at http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews.

The general idea is that you'd have some little "hNews" badge on the page
(eg a little hNews logo image) and when the user hovers over it a box will
popup which summarises the hNews data present in the article).


Basic usage
-----------

TODO: how to include the .js / .css file(s)

To attach the popup behaviour to an element in the page:
   $('#someelementid').hnews_popup();

where '#someelementid' is the id of the element you want to attach the popup
behaviour to.


For example, using the standard jquery $.ready() mechanism, your <head> section
might have something like this:

    <script type="text/javascript">
      $(document).ready(function() {
      $('#hnews-badge').hnews_popup();
    });
    </script>

And somewhere else on the article page, you'd have:

  <img id="hnews-badge" alt="this article has hNews" src="hnews_icon.png"/>


Options
-------

Like most jquery plugins, hnews_popup() can take an "options" parameter.
For most cases the default settings should be find, so you can omit the
options parameter altogether.

The available options are:

head_fn
  a function which returns a string of html to use to generate the
  heading of the popup box

foot_fn
  a function which returns html for the foot of the box

row_fn
  a function to generate html to display one 'thing' of the hNews data
  (where a 'thing' might be a title, an author, a license... whatever)
  The function is passed parameters (label,content), where 'label' is
  a human-readable label of the hNews field to display, and 'content'
  is the value of the display. Both might be little html snippets.


Styling
-------

The default styling is determined by "hnews_popup.css" and by the
"head_fn", "row_fn" and "foot_fn" options passed into hnews_popup().

The default functions display the hNews data using a table. But this
not hard coded, so you can use whatever html you like.

If you want to customise the look and feel, probably the best thing is
to examine the default versions of the options in hnews_popup.js and
the styles in hnews_popup.css, then build your own replacements.


Issues
------

- should pack all js into one minified file
- Should the plugin file have a jquery prefix? eg "jquery.hnews_popup.js"
- is the reliance on jquery an issue? Do we need a non-jquery version?
