Tim Hacker A sign along Hunt Highway thanking visitors to San Tan Valley, shown Tuesday, June 8, 2010. The San Tan Valley lifestyle is defined by all-new development and what residents live without - no police department, no parks and recreation programs for their kids, no city library. Residents of the unincorporated area have sought to change this for years by forming a city, only to see those efforts fizzle. But five years after the last push, residents have assumed the area's most formidable incorporation effort to date. This push has been better organized and is attempting to spark discussion though the summer with a series of panel discussions where residents can ask experts about what forming a city would mean to the area's 80,000 people and to their pocketbooks. They are collecting signatures to place a referendum on the November ballot. Those who have followed the campaigns say this push has a better chance to succeed because it's unlike what happened before. \"The previous effort seemed to include a lot of personalities, which kind of sidetracked it,\" said Bryan Martyn, a Pinal County supervisor who represents the San Tan Valley area. \"The last time, the supporters had a real hard time nailing down why they wanted to do it, what they wanted to gain.\" Now, supporters have plans to address public safety, recreation programs, planning, transportation and economic development. Also, Pinal County worked on a sample budget to show what a city organization would look like and how much it would cost residents. The Citizens for San Tan Valley incorporation points out the area is the state's largest unincorporated community. It would become Arizona's ninth largest city if incorporated. The complexities of a new city can easily confuse many residents who had previously lived in an incorporated area and took services for granted, said Tom Belshe, deputy director of the League of Arizona Cities and Towns. Belshe follows incorporation efforts around the state and has spoken to area residents about the process. \"This is the largest incorporation that I've ever seen,\" Belshe said. \"I think they've done a good job of getting the word out.\" The proponents certainly support incorporation. But Michelle Fiaui, the community relations director, said the group is using a soft sell by promoting the chance for residents to have a voice in an election. The panel discussions are a centerpiece of that, by letting residents learn about city services by speaking with police, transportation and planning officials from other cities. \"They're not there on a pro/con basis and I think that's really the big difference,\" Fiaui said. \"We're trying to be transparent and allow people to get education on what this really is. Here's the experts, ask them yourself.\" The group is still collecting the 3,500 signatures need to get on the ballot. Even supporters acknowledge the effort faces huge hurdles. Arizona law requires cities within 6 miles of the proposed San Tan Valley to have their city councils support the incorporation. Florence officials have raised concerns with the incorporation group because the new city would divert $1 million of state money from Florence. Queen Creek would lose about $54,000 a year, but town spokeswoman Marni Schubert said officials haven't taken a position yet. The economy makes incorporation a more difficult sell also. The new city would impose a property tax of $100 for every $100,000 of a home's value and create a 2 percent sales tax. It would have 75 police officers contracted through the Pinal County Sheriff's Office, instead of the 41 deputies who patrol the area today. \"It's a very lean government,\" said Randy Lockner, chairman of the incorporation group. \"But it does show that for approximately $200 or $300 per household, we can have a city with that government in place.\" Critics say the budget is unrealistically small and would grow, and some retirees oppose incorporation because they would not use many of the services. Johnson Utilities has sent letters in its bills that criticize the incorporation movement and question whether the city's expenses would be dramatically higher. Supporters admit a budget would not be in place until after voters approved incorporation and the county board of supervisors approved a City Council to approve the spending plan. The area had just 4,000 residents in 2001 and is now about twice the size of when the 2005 incorporation effort faded out. The community's large size makes incorporation efforts more challenging than smaller communities, supporters say. Martyn said he knows it's difficult to ask residents to tax themselves in a down economy. But he said the vast county can only adequately serve rural areas and it will never have the funds to provide city-level services. Getting approval to incorporate will become more difficult as the community grows, he said. \"If you're happy with the way things are right now, then that would be a no vote. But this is as good as it gets,\" Martyn said. \"I as the county am providing all that I can. It's discouraging to say the least, wanting to take care of a group of constituents and not being able to take care of them in a way that they've asked to be taken care of.\" San Tan Valley incorporation panel discussions Panels are scheduled from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Poston Butte High School, 32375 N. Gantzel Road. Each includes several experts from the county or other cities. \u2022 June 24: Economic development \u2022 July 22: Transportation \u2022 July 29: Planning and zoning \u2022 Aug. 12: Public Safety \u2022 Sept. 2: parks and recreation More about Incorporation ARTICLE: Gilbert to consider support for incorporation of San Tan Valley ARTICLE: Group wants San Tan Valley to incorporate", "entry-title": "Formidable effort behind latest push to incorporate San Tan Valley", "tag": [ "Incorporation", "Local", "Queen creek", "The valley", "Msnbc", "San Tan Valley", "Incorporation" ], "updated": "Updated: 2:41 pm, Tue Jun 8, 2010." } ];
