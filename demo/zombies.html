<p>There have been widely reported instances over the course of the night of massive numbers of human corpses rising from their graves to attack and eat the living.</p>
<p>An emergency government team of scientists has been assembled to assess the ghoul situation, and have determined that a ghoul can be killed by a disruptive trauma to the brain.</p>
<p>Spokesmen have prepared the following scientific report. Please pass this information on to your friends and neighbours and above all, remain calm.

<blockquote>
This is the state of national emergency<br/>
Mind-blowing massacre at the cemetery<br/>
When the groundskeeper came to check out the place<br/>
They knocked him down and they ate his face<br/>
Little Billy Baker said he saw it first<br/>
A thousand rotten carcasses<br/>
Climbed out of the earth<br/>
Now we're holding a crisis information meeting at the high school<br/>
And we say if you shoot the head you kill the ghoul<br/>
If you shoot the head you kill the ghoul<br/>
<br/>
Come on, this is the state of national emergency<br/>
It's happening in Texas and in Idaho and in Tennessee<br/>
Hideous hordes of crumbling undead men<br/>
Are slaughtering and eating the population<br/>
We've just received word from washington DC<br/>
It's every man for himself against the zombies<br/>
They say a high-powered, short-range weapon is a man's best tool<br/>
And they say if you shoot the head you kill the ghoul<br/>
<br/>
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,<br/>
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,<br/>
aahhhhhh....This is a state of national emergency<br/>
Why is this happening? What are the dead returning?<br/>
Have we gone too far, do we deserve this fate?<br/>
Is Hell too full, have they opened up the gate?<br/>
It's earth last stand against our final death<br/>
They'll eat and eat till there's no one left<br/>
We don't know if it's radiation or if it's something biblical<br/>
But we know if you shoot the head you kill the ghoul<br/>
If you shoot the head you kill the ghoul<br/>
<br/>
If -you - shoot - the - head - you - kill - the - ghoul<br/>
Shoot the head, kill the ghoul<br/>
If -you - shoot - the - head - you - kill - the - ghoul<br/>
Shoot the head, kill the ghoul<br/>
Ah - ah<br/>
Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!<br/>
